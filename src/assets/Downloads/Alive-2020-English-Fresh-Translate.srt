00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,050
 I think I'm here alone. 

52
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:57,320
 Just before, at this point, Yopyeong suddenly stopped 

53
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:10,500
 I don't really know what he's talking about right now, but there's no reason to understand that. 

54
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,290
 I've seen the problem in detail from now on, but the item is not a bit. I really don't know. 

55
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:28,130
 Really nobody knows. When I was riding a light car outside the house, I said ah ah then ah then I'll use the bathroom only once 

56
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:37,659
 Please use the toilet right away. Thank you.

00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:58,960
 Don't control the sample's money The money continues. The infected person is very violent at this point, and also screams. 

59
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:06,020
 Severe and age bleeding are reported as major symptoms. 

60
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:14,990
 The timing has also been confirmed to be widespread. Again, there is a widespread affliction of infected people. 

61
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:22,850
 This means that smokers are not only attacking people, they are performing. 

62
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:31,860
 Bite caused by infected people

 1 Until now, it was extremely violent and dietary, so I thought the cause was related to encephalitis rather than mask. 

115
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:56,410
 On the other hand, I eat a special connection, so I am so desperate for the fruit that the apple is responsive.

 As you can see, in cancer, people are not an external change pat, but after that, they have a rich appearance. 

129
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:21,130

00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,370
 This is the last text my father sent me 

191
00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:45,129
 4 I'm not sure if I can survive this. 

192
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:53,740
 It's also in its heyday that I'm shooting this alive now. 

193
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:02,220
 I'm good at this 

194
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,739
 That 

195
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:20,670

196
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:28,960
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

197
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,740
 But the blood screen resulting from Zipper Total Laden Shooting Angyo 3 [Music] 

198
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,020
 Therefore, it is expected that the president of Tongyeong will not post everything. 

199
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:50,800
 Except for the violentity and c function features of the screening, the sequential medical history of tactile sensation after visual inspection is confirmed to be people and teachers. 

200
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:58,240
 It is also characteristic that there is a dog fare that is sometimes prevented in the Hong Kong pattern. Come to me in the paddy field or remember the job of the elderly. 

201
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:08,160
 쫑 It was repeated, etc., or several years old. 

202
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:17,629

203
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:23,499
 Oh, people2 

204
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,790
 Ugh 

205
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:40,320
 4 4 From the Bible 

206
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:49,060
 This is something like Ele, but what is it? I'm going to show you how to breathe to calm your heart today. 

207
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,270

208
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,380

00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:22,260
 OMG 

212
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
 Ugh 

213
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:34,640
 Ah ah 4 

214
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,530
 Ah 

215
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,440
 Yes 

216
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,799
 Ugh 

217
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:01,140
 It’s another place. 

218
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:06,110
 Now this important thing will fall apart 

219
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:13,600
 Nevertheless, I never go out of the house. 

220
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,400
 Rather, yes, it's just the same thing on Earth. 

221
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:25,270
 I was waiting in the house, but what is going on? 

222
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,740
 I didn't watch TV very well. I can do it while cleaning. 

223
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,900
 Then I also send a story from Ajou 

224
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:45,969
 Since there are so many accidents in epilation, an app that can only catch an emergency disaster broadcast from a few years ago with only fm frequency without hand pull 

225
00:27:45,969 --> 00:27:48,599
 I made it 

226
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:58,400
 It's not a disaster. It's a 3 second pit sound in a disaster. 

227
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,970
 Earphone book 

228
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:10,250
 There is a girl who is Asian buta [music] 

229
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,930

232
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:50,700
 It’s because there’s no sea like this. 

233
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,380
 I'm going to throw away more birds 

234
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:03,890

236
